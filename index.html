				</li>
				<p>Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture.</p>
				<li><a href="https://www.lawfirms.com/resources/technology-law/technology-and-intellectual-property/copyright-internet.htm">Copyright Law on the Internet</a>
				</li>
				<p>Internet copyright laws give the original authors or artists the right to exclude others from copying their work or claiming it as their own. </p>

				</li>
				<p>If you ever want to earn money on musical composition or sound recording, and if you’re going to protect that right and ensure that people aren’t stealing your work, you need to know your copyright protections. </p>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/copyright/">Youtube Copyright</a>
				</li>
				<p>Creators should only upload videos that they have made or that they're authorized to use. That means they should not upload videos they didn't make, or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos made by other users, without necessary authorizations.</p>

				</li>
				<p>Marketing on social media is nothing new, but with the world in various forms of lockdowns, social media has become one of the main forms of communication to the public.  Therefore, every marketing professional should think about the intersection of copyright law and social media.</p>
